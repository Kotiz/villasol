In one of them there are jacuzzi and sauna. The building is located near the railway station, on a quiet street in the Zasola estate. Thanks to the excellent location, you can take a walk to the Oświęcim market square as well as visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum. In the area you can find the shopping mall, shops and public transport stops. For guests with children, the city playground, located about five minutes away on foot will be an attraction.
